    "## Modern Database\n",
    "There is two modern database right now\n",
    "- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** : SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite\n",
    "\t\t1970, \n",
    "\t\tUsing Structured Query Language for query. \n",
    "\t\tUsing tabular structure or column and row. Data deduplication. \n",
    "\t\tExpensive to scale.\n",
    "\t\tSave structured data.\n",
    "\t\tUsing ACID, Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability for data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "- **NoSQL (or Not Only SQL)** is Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, and Cosmos DB\n",
    "\t\t2000s. \n",
    "\t\tUsing its own language for query.\n",
    "\t\tEasier to scale or change its structured. No need for schema and don't have relation between table.\n",
    "\t\tSave unstructured data. \n",
    "\t\tNot using ACID for faster performance and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision for using RDBMS or NoSQL is depend on the type of data, scalability(vertical or horizontal), data consistency or integrity, performance, and query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity Framework\n",
    "ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is used to associate **columns in table** with **properties in classes**.\n",
    "The truly version that support cross-platform is called EF Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "##### Database First \n",
    "Database already exist, build a model to matches its structure and features.\n",
    "##### Code First \n",
    "No database exist, build model and use EF to generate the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Create a Console App for EF Core (Database First)\n",
    "First sample database by Microsoft in early 1990s, that we will create it later.\n",
    "![Northwind Diagram](Northwind.png \"Diagram Northwind\")\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### *Note*\n",
    "> 1. Install SQLite3 and set the path\n",
    "> 2. Create Database (if the database not created yet)\n",
    "> 3. Make a class that represent connection to the database, you can use a class that inherit from `DbContext`\n",
    "> 4. Map a table by creating a class that have multiple properties and set the relation to another classs\n",
    "> 5. After create a table classes or `entity`, declare it on the database class or the `DbContext` by using `DbSet<>`\n",
    "##### Install SQLite\n",
    "SQLite is small, cross-platform, easy to manage or deploy, and common RDBMS that used on mobile apps.\n",
    "1. You can download it via `sqlite.org/download.html` and choose `Precompiled Binaies Section` and pick the bundle of command line tools.\n",
    "2. Extract it to root of C:\\\\SQLite\n",
    "3. Windows Settings > Edit the System Environment Variables > Environment Variables > System Variables > Select Path > enter C:\\\\SQlite\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create the Database from SQL\n",
    "1. Put the `sql script` inside the project folder\n",
    "2. Run the Windows Terminal, run `sqlite3 Northwind.db -init Northwind4SQLite.sql`\n",
    "3. Wait until it shows `Northwind.db` \n",
    "4. Check data inside it using SQLite Studio\n",
    "\t1. Download http://sqlitestudio.pl\n",
    "\t2. Add database\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create Northwind Database context class\n",
    "1. Create a public class that represent the database\n",
    "2. Inherit it from `DbContext`\n",
    "3. Override a method name `OnConfiguring` , its use to set the database connection string\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; // DbContext, DbContextOptionsBuilder \n",
    "namespace DatabaseNorthwind; // this manages the connection to the database \n",
    "public class Northwind : DbContext \n",
    "{ \n",
    "\tprotected override void OnConfiguring( DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) \n",
    "\t{ \n",
    "\t\tstring path = Path.Combine( Environment.CurrentDirectory, \"Northwind.db\"); \n",
    "\t\tstring connection = $\"Filename={path}\"; \n",
    "\t\toptionsBuilder.UseSqlite(connection); \n",
    "\t} \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. In `Main program`\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using DatabaseNorthwind;\n",
    "Northwind db = new Northwind();\n",
    "Console.WriteLine($\"Provider: {db.Database.ProviderName}\");\n",

    "### Defining EF Core Models\n",
    "There is three way to define EF Models or entity. \n",
    "You can use\n",
    "- Conventions\n",
    "- Annotation Attributes\n",
    "- Fluent API\n",
    "#### Use Convention\n",
    "1. Name of the class will be plurals on the database property. \n",
    "\tClass `Product` will be present table `Products`\n",
    "2. Name of the property that use `Id` will be the primary key\n",
    "\tClass `Product` have property `ProductId`, it will be the primary key\n",
    "3. String type is `nvarchar` in database\n",
    "#### Use Annotations\n",
    "`[Require]` is for property that must have a value, the value is not null\n",
    "`[StringLength(50)]` for declare the string up to 50 characters in length\n",
    "`[Column(TypeName = \"money\", Name = \"UnitPrice\")]` is for declare the column type and column name that used in the table\n",
    "#### Use Fluent API\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "modelBuilder.Entity<Product>() \n",
    "\t\t\t.Property(product => product.ProductName) \n",
    "\t\t\t.IsRequired() \n",
    "\t\t\t.HasMaxLength(40);\n",
    "modelBuilder.Entity<Product>() \n",

    "modelBuilder.Entity<Category>() \n",

    "modelBuilder.Entity<Product>() \n",
    "\t\t\t.HasOne(p => p.Category) \n",
    "\t\t\t.WithMany(c => c.Products) \n",
    "\t\t\t.HasForeignKey(p => p.CategoryId);\n",
    "```\n",
    "It used for declare in the `Product` class, there will be `ProductName` property that value must be not null, but the maximum length of string is 40 character.\n",
    "For code below, the `Product` class will be have data at least one row that can use `HasData` method. It called `data seeding`\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "modelBuilder.Entity<Product>() \n",
    "\t\t\t.HasData(\n",
    "\t\t\t\tnew Product \n",
    "\t\t\t\t{ \n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tProductId = 1, \n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tProductName = \"Chai\", \n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tUnitPrice = 8.99M \n",
    "\t\t\t\t});\n",

    "Process by using `dotnet ef tools` to create class by use reverse engineering.\n",

    "\tdotnet tool list --global\n",
