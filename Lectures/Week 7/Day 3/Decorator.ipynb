    "\n",
    "At some point, you realize that users of the library expect more than just email notifications. Many of them would like to receive an SMS about critical issues. Others would like to be notified on Facebook and, of course, the corporate users would love to get Slack notifications.\n",

    "\n",
    "But then someone reasonably asked you, “Why can’t you use several notification types at once? If your house is on fire, you’d probably want to be informed through every channel.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You tried to address that problem by creating special subclasses which combined several notification methods within one class. However, it quickly became apparent that this approach would **bloat the code immensely**, not only the library code but the client code as well.\n",

    "Extending a class is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to alter an object’s behavior. However, inheritance has several serious caveats that you need to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is static. You can’t alter the behavior of an existing object at runtime. You can only replace the whole object with another one that’s created from a different subclass.\n",
    "Subclasses can have just one parent class. In most languages, inheritance doesn’t let a class inherit behaviors of multiple classes at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to overcome these caveats is by using **Aggregation or Composition instead of Inheritance**."
