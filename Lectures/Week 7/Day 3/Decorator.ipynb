    "- You can extend an object’s behavior without making a new subclass.\n",

    "- Adapter provides a different interface to the wrapped object, Proxy provides it with the same interface, and Decorator provides it with an enhanced interface.\n",
    "- Composite and Decorator have similar structure diagrams since both rely on recursive composition to organize an open-ended number of objects.\n",
